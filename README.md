# Techxplorer's Utility Scripts #
This repository contains a number of utility scripts that I have developed in the course of my work to make things easier. They are published here in the hope that they prove useful to others.

If you find these scripts useful please [let me know](https://github.com/techxplorer/), if you find they don't work or there are other issues please [add an issue](https://github.com/techxplorer/techxplorer-utils/issues) to let me know.

These scripts have been developed and tested on Mac OS X and as such should work for other Unix like operating systems. If you're working on Windows they're likely to not work. 

## Installation ##
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file
2. Install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)
3. Download and install the dependencies with Composer
4. If required, edit the configuration file for the script
5. Run the script

## Available Scripts ##

Documentation on the available scripts is contained in [the wiki](https://github.com/techxplorer/techxplorer-utils/wiki).
