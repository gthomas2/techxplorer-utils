# Techxplorer's Utility Scripts #
This repository contains a variety of scripts, that I have developed and maintain in my own time, while working for [NetSpot](http://netspot.com.au/). The scripts are written in [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), which is the programming language I work in the most. They are published here in the hope that they prove useful to others. 

If you find these scripts useful please [let me know](https://github.com/techxplorer/). If you find they don't work, please [add an issue](https://github.com/techxplorer/techxplorer-utils/issues) to let me know.

## Supported Platforms ##
These scripts have been developed and tested on [OS X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X) and as such many of them should work for other [Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)/[Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) like operating systems. 

Some of the scripts are OS X specific. When this is the case it is noted on the wiki page for the script. 

If you're working on [Microsoft Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) they're likely to not work at all.

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file
2. Install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)
3. Download and install the dependencies with Composer
4. If required, edit the configuration file for the script
